In this project from [The Odin Project](http://theodinproject.com), I created a static website that allows users to "draw" with squares. The user can determine how large or small the grid is.

Buttons allow the grid to be remade, cleared, or create random colors when hovered.

Skills used:
 - HTML
 - CSS
 - JavaScript/jQuery
 - Chrome DevTools
